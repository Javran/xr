Congratulations on passing all the tests!

- I like this solution is readable.

- I like the use of
```rust
(end..=start)
```
instead of
```rust
(end..start + 1)
```

If you cared to, for a further challenge you might try to convert the if
expressions into a [match
expression](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/match-expr.html).

Viewing the community solutions may offer other approaches to this exercise
which you may find interesting.
