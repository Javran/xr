If you're not already using it, you may want to try
[rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/). It should be toward the top
when searching for rust extensions in vscode. I switched back-and-forth between
rust-analyzer and RLS before staying with rust analyzer, particularly since [the
current tentative plan is indeed that rust-analyzer supersedes RLS in the
near-ish future](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/01/rust-analyser-ide-support/).
