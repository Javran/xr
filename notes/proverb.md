Congratulations on passing all the tests!

- I like that this solution is succinct and readable.

- I like how this solution uses `windows`.

- I like how this solution uses `format`.

- I like the `match` on `first` with `Some` and `None` arms.

- I like how this solution uses `join`.

- I like this solution directly returns `verse.join` without using `return` and a semicolon.

- I like this solution displays an understanding of `peekable`.

- I like the `match` on `peek` with `Some` and `None` arms.

Some people use any of
[zip](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.zip),
[map](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.map),
[chain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.chain),
[collect](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.collect),
[windows](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.windows), or
[join](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.join) for the
solution. There's no one right idiomatic way.
